\section{Validating our model \label{validation}}
To prove that the model behaves as expected, model light curves are generated by a set of brightness values.
\subsection{What is variable? \label{variable}}
After the models are made, the only things that vary for the reproduction is the number of boxes and stripes and the binning cadences. The number of boxes and stripes are set to six and eighteen respectively.  %This section isn't really a section....

%Give a description of the parameters that we still can mess with. For example, the number of stripes, number of boxes, and binning cadences both in and out-of- transit.
